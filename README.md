This Repository mainly created to focus on the work-done in  5 Days workshop of Adavance Physical Design using OpenLANE/SkyWater130. The Workshop mainly focus on  to  hands on experience of the efabless OpenLANE VLSI design flow RTL2GDS and the Skywater 130nm PDK. OpenLANE is an open source VLSI flow built around open source tools with the goal to produce clean GDSII with no human intervention. PicoRV32 is a CPU core that implements the RISC-V RV32IMC Instruction Set .In this course this is used as an example to explain the flow .
